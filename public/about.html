<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm just a girl tryna find a place in this world.</p>

<p>My hobbies are reading novels, mostly fantasy romance, and playing games and I am also trying to learn to play 
  guitar although failing in it.</p>

<p>One of my problems in life are my skills which I am still not able to build even in my 3rd year which causes so much anxiety in me but I won't give up on coding as long as I live.</p>
